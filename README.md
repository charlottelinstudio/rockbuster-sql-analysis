# Rockbuster SQL Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global video rental company, using SQL and data analytics to uncover insights into customer behavior, pricing efficiency, and revenue distribution. The analysis forms part of my Data Analytics training (Achievement 3) and demonstrates how SQL can support strategic business decisions.

Key business questions addressed include:
- Where are Rockbuster‚Äôs customers and revenues concentrated globally?
- How do rental prices and durations impact revenue?
- Which customer segments and markets offer the greatest growth potential?
- What films and genres contribute most to revenue performance?

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL) ‚Äì data extraction, transformation, and analysis
- Excel ‚Äì supplemental calculations and cross-checks
- Tableau ‚Äì interactive visualizations and dashboards
- Canva ‚Äì professional presentation design

## Key Findings
- Rockbuster maintains strong customer loyalty, with customers averaging 27 rentals annually.
- $4.99 rentals generated the highest revenue, despite being less frequent. Adjusting the $0.99 tier to $1.99 could drive significant gains.
- Top markets include China, India, Russia, and the U.S., while Brazil and Mexico show emerging potential.
- A handful of high-value customers contribute disproportionately to revenue, highlighting opportunities for loyalty programs.
- Genre analysis revealed that sports, sci-fi, animation, drama, and comedy are the most profitable.
